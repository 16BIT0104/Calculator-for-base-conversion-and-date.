		<h2>Go through this notes to know the mechanism behind the conversion of numbers to different bases.</h2>
		<p>"A set of values used to represent different quantities is known as Number System". For example, a number system can be used to represent the number of students in a class or number of viewers watching a certain TV program etc. The digital computer represents all kinds of data and information in binary numbers. It includes audio, graphics, video, text and numbers. The total number of digits used in a number system is called its base or radix. The base is written after the number as subscript such as 51210</p>
		<p>
			Some important number systems are as follows.
            <ol>
				<li>Decimal number system</li><br>
				<li>Binary number system</li><br>
				<li>Octal number system</li><br>
				<li>Hexadecimal number system</li>
			</ol><br>
			The decimal number system is used in general. However, the computers use binary number system. The octal and hexadecimal number systems are used in the computer.<br>
			I'm adding brief introduction to common number systems here :<br>
			<p>
				1) Binary Number System:<br>
					A Binary number system has only two digits that are 0 and 1. Every number (value) represents with 0 and 1 in this number system. The base of binary number system is 2, because it has only two digits.<br><hr>

				2) Octal number system<br>
                     Octal number system has only eight (8) digits from 0 to 7. Every number (value) represents with 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7 in this number system. The base of octal number system is 8, because it has only 8 digits.<br><hr>

                 3) Decimal number system<br>
                      Decimal number system has only ten (10) digits from 0 to 9. Every number (value) represents with 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, 7,8 and 9 in this number system. The base of decimal number system is 10, because it has only 10 digits.<br><hr>

                 4) Hexadecimal number system<br>
                      A Hexadecimal number system has sixteen (16) alphanumeric values from 0 to 9 and A to F. Every number (value) represents with 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, 7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E and F in this number system. The base of hexadecimal number system is 16, because it has 16 alphanumeric values. Here A is 10, B is 11, C is 12, D is 14, E is 15 and F is 16.<br><hr><br>
